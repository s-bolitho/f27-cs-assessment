doublerAppend is normally running a bit faster than doublerInsert, except for with the tinyArray.
Insert is running almost a full second for the extraLargeArray which is 100,000 units whereas append ran for
only 3 milliseconds for the extraLargeArray. 

Because append is using .unshift it has to increment all the elements that are in the given array.
Insert does not have to change any of the arrays index so this is the reason why insert, using .push, 
runs so much faster than append, using .unshift.
